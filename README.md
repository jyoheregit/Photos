# Photos

Did this project in four hours time in one stretch. Good to test the thinking abilities and coding skills. Was fun :)

The following functionalities are present:

  1. Add Photo.
  2. To view the detail of the photo.
  3. To favorite/unfavorite the photo.
  
Used UICollectionView, UIImagePickerController, UIPageViewController and Core Data.
